# Monthly Planner ![Monthly Planner Preview](./favIcon/project-management3.png)

## Description
The **Monthly Planner** is a simple, interactive web application designed to help you plan and organize your month. With this planner, you can manage goals, track important days, and categorize your hobbies. The planner is divided into five sections, each with a unique theme to help you organize different aspects of your life.

This project was developed as an introductory project to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces. As a fresh learner, I used **local storage** to save user data, ensuring that plans remain available even after refreshing or closing the browser.

## Features
- **Five Sections for Organization**:
  - **Movies to Watch**
  - **Books to Read**
  - **Places to Visit**
  - **Goals**
  - **Important Days**
- **Customizable Background Colors**: Each section has a default background color, which the user can customize according to their preference.
- **Data Persistence with Local Storage**: User inputs are saved using local storage, so your plans remain available even after closing the application.
- **Dynamic and Interactive UI**: Engaging and intuitive interface for smooth user experience.
- **Easy to Use**: Perfect for beginners who want a straightforward way to plan their month.

  ## Usage

- Launch the Planner: Open the index.html file in your browser.
- Add Details in Each Section: Fill out the lists for movies, books, travel destinations, monthly goals, and important days.
- Customize Section Colors: Click on each section's settings to change the background color to your preference.
- Save and Review: Review your monthly plan and make adjustments as you go.

## Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the app.
- JavaScript (ES6+): Core language for building components and managing logic.
- This project uses only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, making it lightweight and easy to modify.
